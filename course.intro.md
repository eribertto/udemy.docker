Hey! This video is going to tell you a little bit about

each section in this course, so you get a good idea of what

we're going to cover.

First, after you get the pre-requirements, like making sure

you have a compatible operating system, making sure you

download the course repo, stuff like that, we'll get into

the installation details of Docker itself.

Docker Desktop works on Mac and Windows 10,

and that's really the best thing to do.

But, there's lots of other details in there about whether

you're using Linux, or an old Windows version, or you just

want to use a server on the Internet.

Then we jump into the Docker basics around

how do you run containers? What is a container?

What's in it? What's not in it?

Running some examples.

Then we learn how to build the images, which are the

building blocks of containers, and you go through some

examples of that.

Then I go into details and examples around networking for

Docker and how that works.

Then maybe some of the storage stuff that you're going to

deal with called Volumes.

Then, we get into Docker Compose, which is a tool that

comes with Docker, but it really is designed for local

Dev and Test, and it's great.

I use it every day when I'm working on projects.

Then, after you understand all of the basics of those

tools, we start talking about orchestration, which is

allowing you to run containers on multiple servers that act

sort of like a single server.

We first start out with Swarm because it comes with Docker

out-of-the-box. It's very easy to understand, and it works

really great in a lot of scenarios.

You'll learn about YAML files and how to configure

multi-container solutions, and distributed systems,

and micro services and all that.

Eventually, you'll want to jump into Kubernetes, which

comes after Swarm.

I teach Swarm before Kubernetes because I think it's a good

stepping stone because Kubernetes is so much more

complicated and does so much more than Swarm.

But, Swarm is easy to understand, so it's a great first

step. I think all of us really need to learn at least

two orchestrators since there's now, I don't know, four or

five, six, at least common ones out there.

Obviously, Kubernetes gets a lot of the market share and

mindshare, but it's not the only solution, and it sometimes

is more complicated than you need.

So, it's good to have multiple tools in your toolset.

That's why I teach both in this course.

Then I finish up the course with a bunch of various things

related to all these topics. Things like student's common

questions and answers, maybe some live stuff

from my YouTube show where students show up and ask

questions about topics in the course that aren't heavily

covered, so I give you some more details on that.

Then, I actually review some student real-world

Docker and Compose files and sort of break them down,

talk about what's good about them, what's bad about them,

so that you can learn from other people's work.

Of course, throughout the whole course, there are tons and

tons of references. Anywhere I can, I put links to

documentation or really good blog posts that I,

or someone else, has made on a topic so you can get further

reading. Then, near the end of the course, I start to give

you jumping off points in case you want to take one of my

other courses that goes into more detail on that topic,

like Swarm Mastery, or maybe Node.js for

Docker, or my forthcoming Kubernetes course.

Obviously, no single course is going to solve

all of your problems and have all the answers.

Along with the Slack Chat, and the YouTube,

and the Podcast, and the newsletter, and the Q&A, and

everything else that we do to try to help you learn these

container tools, you're going to get your questions

answered, one way or another.

Of course, the nice thing about the Slack community is

there's tons of people in there that are happy to help you,

who have a wide range of backgrounds, and it's really

great. I'm really excited that we've had a lot of people

stick around over the years and build that community with

us. Thanks for watching.

I'll see the next video.
